I'm a postdoc (officially, 'postdoctoral research associate') in the School of Informatics, at the University of Edinburgh. I received my PhD at the University of Oxford, under the supervision of Prof. Thomas Lukasiewicz, focussing on deep clustering and general unsupervised machine learning. Currently, I'm working on vision-language learning with Mirella Lapata on visiona and language learning. I've also worked with Mark Steedman on semantic representations and cross-lingual semantics in computational linguistics.

I have a [substack](https://louismahon.substack.com/) where I write about AI and philosophy stuff.
